Counting sort works by counting the number of occurrences of each element and then placing them in their correct positions in the sorted array. It is efficient for arrays with a limited range of key values.
Here is the pseudo code for this sorting algorithm
  countingSort(arr, n)
    count = createArray(MAX)
    for i = 0 to n - 1:
      count[arr[i]] = count[arr[i]] + 1
    output = createArray(n)
    outputIndex = 0
    for i = 0 to MAX - 1:
      for j = 0 to count[i] - 1:
        output[outputIndex] = i
        outputIndex = outputIndex + 1
    for i = 0 to n - 1:
      arr[i] = output[i]

## what is an Algorithm?
* _Algorithm_ is  a set of steps of specific function to solve a problem in an efficient manner.

## Name two common Strategies used in Algorithm
* _1.Brute force method_ : this is a method of solving problems in linear time complexity by going through each of the elements of the given data type. 

* _2. Divide and Conquer approach_: this is a method of solving problems by dividing the sums of data into some halves every time the algorithm runs and usually expressed by time complexity of O(log n)

## what are the parameters used to evaluate a possible solution to a problem?

|measures           | meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
|practicality       | should be viable to be done with available resources on our hand.        |
|time efficiency    | it should be doable with an efficient time         |
|result producing   |  our algorithm should produce a practical solution.       |
